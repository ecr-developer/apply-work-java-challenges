Capitalize The First Letter Of Each Word
```

This Java program defines a function `LetterCapitalize` that takes a string as input, splits it into words, capitalizes the first letter of each word using the `capitalizeFirstLetter` helper function, and then joins the words back into a single string.<br>
The example in the `main` method demonstrates its usage.
